### Background
- Over the past few years, a lot has happened in Hong Kong, and things have changed. Meanwhile, there are [talent and tourist acquisition programmes](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202207/27/P2022072700374.htm) that aim to share the good stories of Hong Kong with the world.
- Following up on our previous work with the [Every Page Ask](../02-Every-Page-Ask) dashboard, we are delving deeper into the trends of Hong Kong's population movement over the years.

### Data Source
Multiple data sources are used in the dashboard to describe the current status of Hong Kong's population movement. The Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department provides population [estimates](https://www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/scode150.html). Movement traffic can be found in the Hong Kong Immigration Department's [data](https://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/message_from_us/stat_menu.html). As a proxy for understanding immigration patterns, [MPF withdrawal](https://www.mpfa.org.hk/en/info-centre/research-reports/quarterly-reports/mpf-schemes) and [BN(O) visa issue](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/managed-migration-datasets#entry-clearance-visas-granted-outside-the-uk) are also considered as part of the informative figures.
