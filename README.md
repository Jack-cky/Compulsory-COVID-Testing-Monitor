<br>Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hong Kong Government (HKG) strove to achieve [Dynamic Zero Infection](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202201/30/P2022013000492.htm) by introducing vaccine passports to encourage public vaccinations. Furthermore, the HKG exercised its power under the Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance (Chapter 599) to require individuals who had been present at specified premises to undergo a COVID-19 nucleic acid test.

To effectively monitor the COVID situation, we built an end-to-end pipeline solution that gathered data and created a dashboard. This dashboard allowed the public (end users) to understand the status of the pandemic and alerted them to potential outbreaks in their neighbourhoods.

## Motivation: Visualising the Compulsory Test Frequency
Earlier, we came across an intriguing [post](https://forum.hkgolden.com/thread/7600216/page/1) on HKGolden discussing the nuisances caused by the Compulsory Testing Notice (CTN) and the desire for a _Dragon Tiger Billboard_ (also known as _ÈæçËôéÊ¶ú_ in Chinese or _ranking billboard_ in English), which ranks the buildings that appeared most frequently on the CTN.

Unfortunately, there was no official publication providing such a ranking. The CTN was presented in PDF format, making it challenging to grasp the status of each location. Inspired by this idea, we initiated a project to create a dashboard that conveniently visualises the frequency of specified premises being listed on the CTN.

## How Many Times Had You Been Selected?
If you resided in Hong Kong in 2022, it was likely that you were asked to undergo a COVID test. However, did you know how many times you were officially requested to take a test?

### Finding the Latest Updates
Simply visit the **Compulsory COVID Testing Monitor** on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jack.cky/viz/HongKongCompulsoryTestingNoticeDragonTigerBillboard/CTN), and you can find the most recently affected buildings.

> [!WARNING]  
> The dashboard is no longer being updated, and the last recorded entry for the CTN was on December 23, 2022.

### Hosting Your CTN Monitor Pipeline
You can host the data pipeline in your preferred environment. The instructions below guide you through the deployment process. We use the [Adobe PDF Extract API](https://developer.adobe.com/document-services/apis/pdf-extract/) in the pipeline, which requires API credentials. You can create one for free by following their [instructions](https://developer.adobe.com/document-services/docs/overview/pdf-extract-api/quickstarts/python/).

> [!CAUTION]  
> The pipeline is deprecated because we had already achieved _Dynamic Zero Infection_ üëåüèª.

<details>
  <summary>üíª Local Host (Recommended)</summary>
  Being lightweight, the pipeline is designed for a localhost with local directories. It is highly recommended to host it on a local computer for cost efficiency. Before following the steps, make sure your computer has <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a> installed to run the pipeline.
  
  1. Clone the repository and navigate into the folder.
      ```sh
      $ git clone https://github.com/Jack-cky/Compulsory-COVID-Testing-Monitor.git
      $ cd Compulsory-COVID-Testing-Monitor
      ```
  2. Set up the configuration for execution.
      ```sh
      $ cp ./config/.env.example ./config/.env
      ```
  3. Update the API credentials inside `./config/.env`.
      ```
      CLIENT_ID=PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_ID
      CLIENT_SECRET=PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_SECRET
      ```
  4. (Optional) By default, the pipeline processes only today‚Äôs records if a date range is not defined.
      ```
      DATE_FROM=20220111
      DATE_TO=20221223
      ```
  5. Set up a virtual environment.
      ```sh
      $ make init
      ```
  6. Execute the pipeline.
      ```sh
      $ make run
      ```

<details>
  <summary>üê≥ Docker Host</summary>
  Although the pipeline is designed for local directories, the content can still be mounted to retrieve the output data. Before following the steps, make sure that your computer has <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> installed to run the pipeline.
  
  1. Clone the repository and navigate into the folder.
      ```sh
      $ git clone https://github.com/Jack-cky/Compulsory-COVID-Testing-Monitor.git
      $ cd Compulsory-COVID-Testing-Monitor
      ```
  2. Set up the configuration for execution.
      ```sh
      $ cp ./config/.env.example ./config/.env
      ```
  3. Update the API credentials inside `./config/.env`.
      ```
      CLIENT_ID=PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_ID
      CLIENT_SECRET=PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_SECRET
      ```
  4. (Optional) By default, the pipeline processes only today‚Äôs records if a date range is not defined.
      ```
      DATE_FROM=20220111
      DATE_TO=20221223
      ```
  5. Execute the pipeline.
      ```sh
      $ docker run --env-file ./config/.env -v "$(pwd)/data:/ctn-monitor/data" -v "$(pwd)/logs:/ctn-monitor/logs" jackcky/ctn-monitor
      ```

## Solution Architecture
The architecture is quite straightforward. Every day, the **Centre for Health Protection** releases a [CTN](https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/features/105294.html) that is structured in a table format in PDF, detailing all specified locations.

For the extraction of these tables, we utilise the **Adobe PDF Extract API**, which accurately captures tables in PDF format compared to other open-source tools. To enrich the dataset, we supplement the addresses with spatial information using the **Hong Kong Address Parser** to access HKG's [APIs](https://github.com/chunlaw/HKAddressParser).

The ETL process is performed using **Pandas**, which consolidates the data into an **Excel** file. This file then serves as the data source for the dashboard. The dashboard is crafted in **Tableau** and published on Tableau Public for the general public to review.

### Production Scenario
To productionise the pipeline, the output destination needs to be changed depending on the situation. Suppose you want to deploy the pipeline in an **AWS** environment, the data layer will be directed to a **S3** bucket. A **Lambda** function could then be scheduled to execute a Docker image (further development required) once every night. Assuming the dashboard serves the end user 24/7, it would require approximately USD 0.10 per month for operation. Detailed price calculations can be found on the [calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/estimate?id=ecd9871ebad63384635c2b8eeed40fce0ba9127e).
